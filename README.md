# Tau statistic speedup
An optimised implementation of the tau statistic (relative prevalence ratio form), originally from R's `IDSpatialStats` package.

I was evaluating the 'elevated prevalence' form of the tau statistic as we had data for the underlying population (i.e. non-cases as well as cases) containing months of disease onset and UTM coordinates of their household. I optimised the implementation of the tau statistic from the development repo of the `IDSpatialStats::get.tau()` function, leading to ~**52x speedup**.

which is the ratio of the odds of finding any case *j* which is related (*z_ij = 1, else 0*) to any case *i*, within an annulus region (radii *d_1*,*d_2*) around case *i*, versus the same but at any *d_ij* distance separation (including *d_ij=0*).
Where the odds are estimates as:

which is the ratio of the number of related case pairs within a specified distance versus the same for unrelated case pairs, for *N* cases with indicatory function **1**(â‹…). 

The relatedness of a case pair *z_ij*, is determine here using temporal information.

Thank you to [CodeCogs](https://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php "CodeCogs LaTeX equation editor, just copy+paste in the HTML they provide") for renderring the mathematical formulae, let's hope they don't close down their domain. Github **still** doesn't seem to think renderring LaTeX in README.md is part of core functionality in developing/describing code!
